# Motor Studio - What to Do Next

## üéØ Summary

Your Motor Studio **did work before**, which means your setup is capable of connecting. Something just needs to be reset.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

From our diagnostics:
- **COM3 is available** (USB-SERIAL CH340)
- **Motor Studio is installed** (version 0.0.8)
- **Configuration is correct** (COM3, 921600 baud)
- **No software conflicts** (no Python blocking the port)
- **Hardware is functional** (adapter and motor both working)

## üìã Quick Fix - Try This First

### Option A: Run the Automated Reset (EASIEST)

1. **Double-click:** `prepare_motorstudio_connection.bat`
2. **Follow the prompts** - it will guide you through:
   - Closing Python processes
   - Unplugging adapter
   - Power cycling motor
   - Replugging everything
3. **Open Motor Studio** when script finishes
4. **Click Connect**

### Option B: Manual Reset

1. **Close everything** (Motor Studio, any Python scripts)
2. **Unplug USB-CAN adapter** from PC
3. **Turn OFF motor power** (12V supply switch)
4. **Wait 10 seconds**
5. **Turn ON motor power** (check LEDs: Red + Blinking Blue)
6. **Wait 5 seconds**
7. **Plug in USB-CAN adapter**
8. **Wait 5 seconds**
9. **Open Motor Studio**
10. **Select COM3, baudrate 921600**
11. **Click Connect**

## üîß If That Doesn't Work

### Try Different Baudrates

In Motor Studio connection settings, try these baudrates:
1. **921600** (current)
2. **1000000** (1 Mbps)
3. **500000** (500 kbps)
4. **115200** (standard SLCAN)

### Try Different Protocol

Look for protocol dropdown, try:
- SLCAN
- L91
- Auto-detect

### Check Motor LEDs

**Should be:** Solid Red + Blinking Blue
- If different: Power cycle motor
- If off: Check 12V power supply

### Run Diagnostics Again

After trying the reset:
```bash
python troubleshoot_motorstudio.py
```

This will verify everything is ready for connection.

## üéì What Happens After You Connect

### Once Motor Studio Connects:

1. **You'll see motor data:**
   - Current position
   - Velocity
   - Status indicators
   - Real-time updates

2. **Find the Mode setting:**
   - Look for "Control Mode" or "Operating Mode"
   - Change it to: **"Position Mode"** or **"MIT Mode"**

3. **SAVE IT:**
   - Click "Save to Motor" or "Write to Device"
   - This is critical - changes must be saved!

4. **Test it:**
   - Use position slider in Motor Studio
   - Motor should physically move
   - If it moves: SUCCESS!

5. **Close Motor Studio:**
   - Setting is saved permanently in motor
   - You never need Motor Studio again

6. **Test with Python:**
   ```bash
   python example_kscale_usage.py 1
   ```
   - Motor should move smoothly
   - If it does: EVERYTHING IS WORKING!

## üÜò If Still Stuck

### Contact Robstride

Use this email template (in MOTORSTUDIO_CONNECTION_GUIDE.md):
- Explain Motor Studio won't connect
- Mention it worked before with same setup
- Ask for exact connection settings
- Request connection guide/video

### Things to Try:
1. Different computer (Windows laptop)
2. Run Motor Studio as Administrator
3. Reinstall USB-CAN driver
4. Try different USB port (USB 2.0 vs 3.0)
5. Ask Robstride for different Motor Studio version

## üí° Why This Happens

Motor Studio not connecting after working before is usually:

1. **Firmware State** - Motor firmware got stuck in a state
2. **CAN Bus** - Bus needs full reset
3. **Adapter State** - USB-CAN adapter needs power cycle
4. **Windows** - COM port needs refresh

**Solution:** Full power cycle of everything (which the scripts help with)
