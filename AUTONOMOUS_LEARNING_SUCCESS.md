## 🔥 Example Chains Created

The system automatically discovered these multi-hop connections:

**Physics:**
- fire → heat → warmth → comfort (4 hops)
- fire → light → vision → seeing (4 hops)
- heat → energy → motion → work (4 hops)

**Biology:**
- sun → light → photosynthesis → glucose → energy → life (6 hops!)
- plants → oxygen → life (3 hops)

**Causality:**
- exercise → fitness → health → wellbeing (4 hops)
- reading → knowledge → understanding → wisdom (4 hops)

And then created **LEAP shortcuts** for all of them!
