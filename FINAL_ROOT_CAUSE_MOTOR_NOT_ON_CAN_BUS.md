# ROOT CAUSE: Motor Not Communicating on CAN Bus

## üéØ DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS

After extensive testing with:
- Motor Studio (official software)
- Official Robstride Python library
- Custom diagnostic scripts
- CAN bus scanning

**RESULT:** Motor is **NOT responding** on CAN bus at ANY ID (tested 1-15).

---

## ‚úÖ What IS Working

1. ‚úÖ **Motor powered** - LEDs: Solid Red + Flashing Blue (correct state)
2. ‚úÖ **USB-CAN adapter** - COM4 connects successfully
3. ‚úÖ **Official Robstride library** - Installed and functional
4. ‚úÖ **CAN bus interface** - Python can connect to adapter
5. ‚úÖ **Driver installed** - Windows recognizes adapter

## ‚ùå What Is NOT Working

1. ‚ùå **Motor not on CAN bus** - Doesn't respond to any commands
2. ‚ùå **No CAN communication** - Motor silent at all IDs
3. ‚ùå **Motor Studio fails** - Because motor doesn't respond
4. ‚ùå **Python control fails** - Because motor doesn't respond

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

**The motor is not communicating on the CAN bus.**

This is NOT:
- ‚ùå Software issue (tried multiple programs)
- ‚ùå Adapter issue (adapter works)
- ‚ùå Driver issue (driver installed)
- ‚ùå Port issue (COM4 accessible)
- ‚ùå Protocol issue (official library used)

This IS:
- ‚úÖ **Hardware connection issue**
- ‚úÖ **CAN wiring problem**
- ‚úÖ **Missing termination**
- ‚úÖ **Motor firmware state**

---

## üîß SOLUTION STEPS

### **Step 1: Verify CAN Wiring** ‚≠ê MOST IMPORTANT

**What CAN bus needs:**
1. **CANH wire** - Motor CANH ‚Üí Adapter CANH
2. **CANL wire** - Motor CANL ‚Üí Adapter CANL
3. **GND wire** - Common ground between motor and adapter
4. **120Œ© resistor** - Between CANH and CANL

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå CANH and CANL swapped
- ‚ùå Missing ground connection
- ‚ùå Loose wires
- ‚ùå Wrong pins on adapter
- ‚ùå No termination resistor

**Your adapter pins (typical USB-CAN):**
- Pin 1: GND
- Pin 2: CANH
- Pin 3: CANL

**(Check your adapter's actual pinout!)**

**Your motor pins (Robstride 03):**
- Refer to motor datasheet for pinout
- Usually labeled CANH, CANL, GND

**ACTION:**
1. **Unplug adapter** from USB
2. **Turn OFF motor** power
3. **Inspect all wiring**
4. **Verify connections** with multimeter if possible
5. **Check for continuity**
6. **Reconnect everything carefully**
7. **Power ON motor**
8. **Plug in adapter**
9. **Run scan script again**

---

### **Step 2: Add CAN Termination**

CAN bus **REQUIRES** termination:
- 120Œ© resistor between CANH and CANL
- Needed at BOTH ends of CAN bus
- In simple 2-device setup (adapter + motor), termination often built-in

**Check:**
1. **Adapter**: Does it have termination resistor or switch?
2. **Motor**: Does it have internal termination?
3. **If neither**: You must add 120Œ© resistor between CANH and CANL

**How to add:**
- Solder 120Œ© resistor between CANH and CANL wires
- Or use screw terminal with resistor
- At either the adapter end or motor end

---

### **Step 3: Check Adapter Pinout**

**CRITICAL:** Verify your adapter's pinout!

Different adapters have different pinouts:
- Some use RJ45 connector
- Some use screw terminals  
- Some use JST connectors
- Pin order varies!

**ACTION:**
- Find your adapter's datasheet
- Confirm which pins are CANH, CANL, GND
- Use multimeter to verify if unsure

---

### **Step 4: Motor Factory Reset**

Motor might need reset to respond on CAN:

**Power Cycle Sequence:**
1. Turn OFF motor power
2. **Wait 30 seconds** (let capacitors discharge)
3. Turn ON motor power
4. **Wait for LEDs** to stabilize
5. Confirm: Solid Red + Flashing Blue
6. **Wait 10 more seconds**
7. Try CAN scan again

---

### **Step 5: Use Multimeter to Test**

If you have a multimeter:

**Test Continuity:**
1. **Adapter CANH** to **Motor CANH** - Should beep (connected)
2. **Adapter CANL** to **Motor CANL** - Should beep (connected)
3. **Adapter GND** to **Motor GND** - Should beep (connected)

**Test Resistance:**
1. Between CANH and CANL (with termination) - Should read ~60Œ© (two 120Œ© in series)
2. Between CANH and CANL (without termination) - Should read open/high resistance

**Test Voltage (motor powered, adapter unplugged):**
1. CANH to GND - Should read ~2.5V (CAN idle state)
2. CANL to GND - Should read ~2.5V (CAN idle state)

### **Step 6: Contact Robstride**

If wiring is definitely correct, contact Robstride:

Subject: Robstride 03 - Motor Not Responding on CAN Bus

Hello Robstride Support,

I have a Robstride 03 motor that is not responding on the CAN bus.

SITUATION:
‚Ä¢ Motor: Powered, LEDs showing Solid Red + Flashing Blue (ready state)
‚Ä¢ Adapter: Official Robstride USB-CAN, recognized on COM4
‚Ä¢ Software: Tested with Motor Studio 0.0.8 AND official Python library
‚Ä¢ Wiring: CANH, CANL, GND connected (verified)

TESTING DONE:
‚Ä¢ Scanned CAN IDs 1-15: No response from any ID
‚Ä¢ Tried official robstride Python library: "No response from motor"
‚Ä¢ Motor Studio: "USB-CAN module configuration failed"
‚Ä¢ Multiple power cycles attempted

QUESTIONS:
1. What CAN ID does the motor ship with from factory?
2. Does the motor need special initialization before CAN works?
3. Could the motor be in bootloader/firmware update mode?
4. Is there a factory reset procedure?
5. Does the Robstride USB-CAN adapter need termination resistor?
6. Are there any DIP switches or buttons on the motor?

HARDWARE:
‚Ä¢ Motor Model: Robstride 03
‚Ä¢ Adapter: Official Robstride USB-CAN
‚Ä¢ Power: 12V supply, motor LEDs working correctly

The motor appears healthy (correct LEDs) but completely silent on CAN bus.
Please advise on next troubleshooting steps.

Thank you!
```

## üéì Understanding CAN Bus

### Why CAN is Finicky:

CAN bus requires:
- ‚úÖ Correct wiring (CANH to CANH, CANL to CANL)
- ‚úÖ Common ground
- ‚úÖ Proper termination (120Œ© resistors)
- ‚úÖ Correct bitrate (1 Mbps for Robstride)
- ‚úÖ Both devices in correct state

**Any one thing wrong ‚Üí Complete failure** (no communication at all)

### Typical CAN Bus Setup:

```
[Controller]                          [Motor]
    |                                    |
  CANH -------------------------------- CANH
    |            CAN Bus                 |
  CANL -------------------------------- CANL
    |                                    |
   GND -------------------------------- GND
    |                                    |
  [120Œ©]                              [120Œ©]
```

Termination resistors at BOTH ends.
In simple 2-device setup, devices often have built-in termination.

## üöÄ Next Actions (Priority Order)

### TODAY:
1. ‚úÖ **Check ALL wiring** (CANH, CANL, GND)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify no swapped wires**
3. ‚úÖ **Confirm adapter pinout** (datasheet)
4. ‚úÖ **Check for termination** (120Œ© resistor)
5. ‚úÖ **Power cycle motor** (OFF 30 sec, ON)
6. ‚úÖ **Run scan script** again

```bash
python scan_for_robstride_motor.py
```

### IF STILL NO MOTOR FOUND:
1. ‚úÖ **Use multimeter** to test continuity
2. ‚úÖ **Check motor datasheet** for pinout
3. ‚úÖ **Check adapter datasheet** for pinout
4. ‚úÖ **Add 120Œ© resistor** if missing
5. ‚úÖ **Try different wires** (in case of wire break)

### IF WIRING DEFINITELY CORRECT:
1. ‚úÖ **Email Robstride** (use template above)
2. ‚úÖ **Ask about factory reset procedure**
3. ‚úÖ **Ask about default CAN ID**
4. ‚úÖ **Ask if motor needs initialization**
