Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.
Natural language processing helps computers understand human language.
Supervised learning uses labeled training data.
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement learning learns through trial and error.
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain.
Convolutional neural networks excel at image recognition.
Recurrent neural networks process sequential data.
Support vector machines are used for classification.
Decision trees make decisions through branching rules.
Random forests combine multiple decision trees.
Gradient boosting improves model accuracy iteratively.
Cross-validation tests model performance on unseen data.
Overfitting occurs when models memorize training data too closely.
Regularization prevents overfitting by adding constraints.
Feature engineering creates useful input variables.
Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of input features.
Clustering groups similar data points together.
Association rules find patterns between different items.
