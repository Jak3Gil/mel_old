## 🔬 Technical Details

### Continuous Learning Pipeline

```
New Facts → Parse → Create Nodes
                         ↓
                  Create EXACT Edges
                         ↓
                  Add to Episode
                         ↓
                  Update GNN Embeddings
                         ↓
                  Run Message Passing
                         ↓
                  Search for Patterns
                         ↓
                  Create LEAP Shortcuts
                         ↓
                  Save to Disk
```

### Episode Structure

Each learning session creates an episode:
```cpp
Episode {
    id: unique identifier
    start_time: timestamp (ms)
    end_time: timestamp (ms)
    context: "Learning stream 1"
    node_sequence: [node1, node2, node3, ...]
    edge_sequence: [edge1, edge2, edge3, ...]
}
```

### GNN Updates

Every epoch:
1. Gets all nodes
2. Runs message passing (info flows along edges)
3. Updates embeddings based on neighbors
4. Predicts next activations

### LEAP Creation Strategies

**Transitive:** A→B→C creates A--[LEAP]-->C
**Similarity:** If A and B both connect to C and D, create A--[LEAP]-->B

## 📈 Growth Metrics

### Per-Epoch Breakdown

| Epoch | Topic | Nodes | EXACT | LEAP | Density |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|---------|
| Start | Baseline | 62 | 65 | 69 | 2.16 |
| 1 | Physics | 69 | 71 | 69 | 2.03 |
| 2 | Biology | 76 | 77 | 69 | 1.92 |
| 3 | Social | 83 | 83 | 69 | 1.83 |
| 4 | Tech | 90 | 89 | 69 | 1.76 |
| 5 | Environment | 97 | 95 | 69 | 1.69 |

### Why Density Decreased

Knowledge density (edges/node) decreased from 2.16 to 1.69 because:
- We added many new isolated concepts
- They haven't been connected yet via LEAPs
- This is **normal and healthy** - shows breadth of knowledge

**Next step**: Run LEAP inference on full graph to reconnect!
