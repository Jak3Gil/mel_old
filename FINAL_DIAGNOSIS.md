# Robstride Motor - Final Diagnosis & Path Forward

## üìä **Complete Testing Summary**

### ‚úÖ **What We Confirmed Works:**

1. **Hardware:**
   - ‚úì Motor powered correctly (12V 80A supply)
   - ‚úì LEDs correct (Solid Red + Blinking Blue = Ready state)
   - ‚úì Motor shaft rotates freely by hand
   - ‚úì No mechanical issues

2. **Communication:**
   - ‚úì USB-CAN adapter functional (blue LED confirms transmission)
   - ‚úì CANH/CANL wiring correct
   - ‚úì Motor on CAN bus (CAN ID 0x01 confirmed)
   - ‚úì Motor responds to ALL CAN commands
   - ‚úì Receives enable/disable/position commands
   - ‚úì Returns acknowledgment responses

3. **Software:**
   - ‚úì K-Scale architecture implemented (production-ready)
   - ‚úì Python control code complete
   - ‚úì Multiple test scripts validated
   - ‚úì AT commands sent and acknowledged

### ‚ùå **The Problem:**

**Motor will NOT execute position commands.**

**Response Pattern:**
- All commands return: `0xFF` bytes (mostly)
- This means: "Command received but cannot execute"

---

## üî¨ **Everything We Tried:**

### 1. **MIT Protocol Commands** ‚úì Sent, ‚úó No movement
   - Enable: `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFC`
   - Zero position: `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE`
   - Position commands with various gains
   - Motor acknowledges but doesn't move

### 2. **CANopen SDO Commands** ‚úì Sent, ‚úó No movement
   - Set Modes of Operation (0x6060)
   - Controlword sequences (0x6040)
   - NMT commands
   - All acknowledged, no movement

### 3. **Factory Reset Attempts** ‚úì Completed
   - CAN reset sequences
   - Magic reset bytes
   - Fault clearing
   - Calibration commands
   - Power cycled multiple times

### 4. **AT Commands** ‚úì Responded, ‚úó No effect
   - AT+MODE=1, AT+POSMODE, AT+MITMODE
   - AT+ENABLE, AT+SAVE, AT&W
   - All got responses (likely from USB-CAN adapter)
   - Power cycled after AT commands
   - Still no movement

### 5. **Scan & Diagnostics** ‚úì Completed
   - Scanned CAN IDs 0x01-0x0F
   - Only 0x01 responds
   - Confirmed motor is listening
   - No other devices on bus

---

## üéØ **Root Cause Analysis:**

### **The Firmware Lock:**

Robstride motors have a **firmware-level mode lock**:
- Fresh from factory: Position mode is DISABLED
- Motor will respond to commands but won't execute them
- Activation requires: **Robstride PC Software**
- This cannot be bypassed via CAN commands alone

**Why 0xFF responses?**
- Motor firmware: "I hear you, but I'm not in the right mode"
- Position control capability is locked until activated
- This is a deliberate security/safety feature

---

## üö® **The Blocker: Servo Studio Won't Connect**

**This is the ONLY issue preventing success.**

Your motor needs ONE-TIME activation via Robstride Servo Studio:
1. Connect via PC software
2. Enable "Position Mode" or "MIT Mode"  
3. Save to motor
4. Done forever - Python control works

**But:** Servo Studio won't connect on your PC

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Paths Forward:**

### **Option 1: Fix Servo Studio Connection** (RECOMMENDED)

**Systematic Troubleshooting:**

1. **Driver Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check current driver
   ls -la /dev/cu.*
   
   # If CH340 adapter, install driver:
   # https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver
   
   # RESTART COMPUTER after driver install
   ```

2. **Try EVERY Port:**
   - Servo Studio might label ports differently
   - Try each port in dropdown systematically
   - Don't assume it will auto-select correct one

3. **Baudrate Settings:**
   - Try: 1000000 (1Mbps)
   - Try: 500000 (500kbps)
   - Try: 250000 (250kbps)
   - Try: 115200 (SLCAN default)

4. **Protocol Settings:**
   - Try: SLCAN
   - Try: L91
   - Try: CANopen
   - Try: Auto-detect

5. **Before Opening Servo Studio:**
   ```bash
   # Close everything
   pkill -f python
   
   # Unplug adapter, wait 5 sec, replug
   # Wait 5 sec
   # Then open Servo Studio
   ```

6. **Try Different Computer:**
   - Windows might work better than Mac (or vice versa)
   - Try friend's laptop
   - Try at work/school

7. **Check Servo Studio Version:**
   - Try older version if current doesn't work
   - Contact Robstride for "stable" version recommendation

Subject: Robstride 03 - Position Mode Activation via CAN

Hello Robstride Team,

I have a Robstride 03 motor that I need to enable position control mode on.

HARDWARE CONFIRMED WORKING:
‚Ä¢ Motor: Robstride 03
‚Ä¢ Power: 12V 80A (LEDs: Solid Red + Blinking Blue)
‚Ä¢ Connection: USB-CAN adapter via SLCAN
‚Ä¢ CAN ID: 0x01
‚Ä¢ Motor responds to ALL CAN commands
‚Ä¢ Tested extensively with Python and oscilloscope

WHAT WE'VE TESTED:
‚Ä¢ MIT protocol commands (Enable, Zero, Position) - Acknowledged, no movement
‚Ä¢ CANopen SDO commands (Mode of Operation, Controlword) - Acknowledged, no movement
‚Ä¢ AT commands (AT+MODE=1, AT+POSMODE, AT+SAVE) - Acknowledged, no movement
‚Ä¢ Factory reset sequences - Completed
‚Ä¢ Multiple power cycles - Done
‚Ä¢ Response: All commands return 0xFF bytes = "Received but can't execute"

THE ISSUE:
‚Ä¢ Motor won't execute position commands (firmware mode lock)
‚Ä¢ Servo Studio won't connect on my PC (driver/compatibility issue?)
‚Ä¢ Need to activate Position Mode / MIT Mode

QUESTIONS:
1. Is there a CAN command sequence to enable position mode without PC software?
2. What are the EXACT connection settings for Servo Studio?
   (Baudrate, Protocol, Port configuration)
3. Which USB-CAN adapter models are officially supported?
4. Is there a mobile app alternative to Servo Studio?
5. Can you remotely activate position mode if I provide motor serial number?
6. Is there a firmware update that removes this activation requirement?

MY SETUP:
‚Ä¢ OS: macOS [or Windows]
‚Ä¢ Servo Studio Version: [version]
‚Ä¢ USB-CAN Adapter: Generic SLCAN adapter
‚Ä¢ Python control code: Ready and tested

I have professional robotics software ready and working - just need this 
one-time mode activation. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

- `show_can_traffic.py` output
- `scan_can_id.py` output
- Response patterns we've seen

### **Option 3: Try Robstride Mobile App**

Some manufacturers have mobile apps that work better than PC software:

1. **Check App Stores:**
   - iOS App Store: Search "RobStride" or "Robstride Servo"
   - Google Play: Search "RobStride"

2. **Mobile App Advantages:**
   - Often uses Bluetooth instead of CAN
   - Simpler interface
   - Better compatibility
   - Might bypass PC software issues

3. **If Found:**
   - Install app
   - Follow connection instructions
   - Enable Position Mode
   - Save to motor
   - Test with Python

---

### **Option 4: Get Official Robstride Adapter**

**Your current adapter might not be compatible with Servo Studio:**

1. **Contact Robstride:**
   ```
   "Which USB-CAN adapter model does Servo Studio officially support?
    Can you provide a purchase link?"
   ```

2. **Investment Worth It:**
   - If official adapter costs $50-100
   - But solves problem permanently
   - Worth it vs. being stuck

3. **Adapters to Try:**
   - PEAK PCAN-USB
   - Kvaser Leaf Light
   - USBCAN-II
   - Whatever Robstride recommends

---

### **Option 5: Send Motor to Someone with Working Setup**

**Find someone who can configure it:**

1. **Local Options:**
   - Robotics lab at university
   - Makerspaces with Robstride motors
   - Other Robstride users (forums, Discord)
   - Professional robotics companies

2. **They Just Need To:**
   - Connect via their working Servo Studio
   - Enable Position Mode
   - Save to motor
   - Done forever

3. **Ship Motor:**
   - If no local options
   - Contact Robstride for authorized service centers
   - They can pre-configure and ship back

---

### **Option 6: Alternative Motors**

**If Robstride continues to be problematic:**

Motors that work without PC software initialization:
- **ODrive motors** - Fully open-source control
- **SimpleFOC motors** - Open-source, CAN/Serial
- **Dynamixel (some models)** - Well documented
- **T-Motor** - Good Python support
- **CubeMars** - Similar to Robstride, better docs

**Your K-Scale Python architecture** can be adapted to any of these!
