## 🌈 What Melvin Can Do Now

### Complete Auditory Cognition Loop

```
1. 🎤 HEAR
   User: "Turn on the stove"
   → AudioPipeline captures
   → Recognizes speech
   → Creates graph nodes
   
2. 👁️ SEE
   Camera detects stove
   → Vision integration
   → Cross-modal link: audio ↔ vision
   
3. 🧠 THINK
   AtomicGraph reasoning
   → Finds action: activate_stove
   → Generates response
   
4. 💭 INTEND
   SpeechIntent processes
   → Creates utterance nodes
   → Links to concepts
   → Marks as self-produced
   
5. 🎙️ SYNTHESIZE
   VocalEngine generates
   → Phoneme sequence
   → Glottal source
   → Formant filtering
   → Coarticulation
   
6. 🔊 SPEAK
   Outputs through speakers
   → Natural voice
   → Biological synthesis
   → No pre-recorded samples
   
7. 🎧 HEAR SELF
   Microphone picks up own voice
   → Self-recognition
   → Feedback link created
   
8. 💾 REMEMBER
   All saved to graph
   → Input heard
   → Thoughts reasoned
   → Words spoken
   → Sounds generated
```

**Complete cognitive cycle!** 🔄

| **2. Integration** | InputManager | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| **3. Cognitive** | SpeechIntent | 10 | 10 | 100% |

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### 1. **Phonemes as Graph Nodes**
```
Every sound Melvin can make is a learnable concept
phoneme:/m/ [PHONEME] → formants: [280, 1620, 2500]
```

### 2. **Biological Voice Generation**
```
No pre-recorded samples!
Glottal source → Formants → Coarticulation → Voice
```

### 3. **Speech as Cognition**
```
Every word spoken:
  - Becomes a graph node
  - Links to semantic meaning
  - Marked as self-produced
  - Can be reflected upon
```

### 4. **Self-Recognition Loop**
```
Melvin speaks → Hears himself → Recognizes → Feedback link
speech_output ↔ audio_input [HEARD_AS]
```

### 5. **Dynamic Learning**
```
Hears new phoneme → Extracts formants → Adds to graph → Can pronounce
```
