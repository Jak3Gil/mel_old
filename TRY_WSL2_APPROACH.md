# Try WSL2 + Linux Approach

## ü§î **Why This Might Help**

Your motor isn't responding on Windows. While this is likely a motor firmware issue, Linux often has:
- Better USB-CAN driver support
- More mature SLCAN tools
- Different driver behavior that might wake up the motor

## üìã **Setup Steps**

### **1. Install WSL2 (if not already)**

```cmd
# In PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --install
```

Restart computer when prompted.

### **2. Install Ubuntu in WSL2**

```cmd
# In PowerShell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

Create username/password when prompted.

### **3. Install USBIPD**

**On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
winget install --interactive --exact dorssel.usbipd-win
```

**In WSL2 (Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install linux-tools-generic hwdata
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip /usr/lib/linux-tools/*-generic/usbip 20
```

### **4. Connect USB Device to WSL2**

**On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
# List USB devices
usbipd list

# Find your USB-CAN adapter (look for CH340 or similar)
# Note the BUSID (e.g., 1-4)

# Attach to WSL
usbipd bind --busid 1-4
usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-4
```

**In WSL2, verify:**
```bash
lsusb
# Should show your USB device

ls /dev/ttyUSB*
# Should show /dev/ttyUSB0 or similar
```

### **5. Install Python Dependencies in WSL2**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install python-can pyserial pyyaml
pip3 install robstride
```

### **6. Clone Your Repo in WSL2**

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Jak3Gil/Melvin.git
cd Melvin
git checkout motor-control-kscale
```

### **7. Update Scripts for Linux**

Scripts will need to use `/dev/ttyUSB0` instead of `COM4`:

```python
# Instead of:
COM_PORT = "COM4"

# Use:
COM_PORT = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
```

### **8. Try Scanning on Linux**

```bash
python3 scan_for_robstride_motor.py
```

---

## ‚ö° **Quick Test (If WSL2 Already Installed)**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell (as Admin):
usbipd list
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <YOUR-BUSID>

# Then in WSL2:
python3 listen_for_can_traffic.py
```

## üéØ **Why This MIGHT Help**

1. **Different USB driver stack** - Linux kernel handles USB differently
2. **Native SLCAN** - Linux has better CAN support
3. **Different initialization** - Might send different signals that wake motor
4. **Debugging tools** - Linux has `candump`, `cansend` for raw CAN

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reality Check**

**HOWEVER:** If the motor firmware is truly stuck (not responding at hardware level), even Linux won't help. 

The motor is:
- Not sending CAN messages at all
- Not responding to any commands
- Completely silent on the bus

**This suggests motor firmware issue, not OS issue.**

But it's worth trying Linux because:
- Quick to test (30 min setup)
- Might reveal something we're missing
- Eliminates Windows as variable

---

## üîß **Alternative: Live USB Linux**

Don't want to install WSL2? Try Linux Live USB:

1. Download Ubuntu Live USB (23.10 or later)
2. Create bootable USB with Rufus
3. Boot from USB (don't install)
4. Plug in USB-CAN adapter
5. Try motor communication from Linux

---

## üí° **My Recommendation**

**Priority:**
1. ‚úÖ **First**: Email Robstride (motor firmware issue most likely)
2. ‚úÖ **Then**: Try Linux if you want (might reveal something)
3. ‚úÖ **Last resort**: Wait for Robstride support

**Time investment:**
- WSL2 setup: ~30 minutes
- Testing: ~10 minutes
- **Total**: ~40 minutes

Worth trying if you're waiting for Robstride response anyway.

---

## üìä **Expected Outcome**

**Most likely:** Linux will also show no motor response (because motor firmware stuck)

**Possible:** Linux drivers interact differently and motor wakes up (rare but possible)

**Either way:** You'll have eliminated OS as variable and confirmed it's motor issue.
