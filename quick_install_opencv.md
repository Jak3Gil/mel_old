# üìù OpenCV Installation Status

## Current Status

**OpenCV is currently being installed in the background by Homebrew.**

You can see the installation process running:
- Process ID 35027: Main brew install
- Process ID 36361: Downloading gcc dependency

## What's Happening

Homebrew is installing OpenCV and its ~140 dependencies. This includes:
- gcc (compiler)
- ffmpeg (video processing)
- python dependencies
- Qt (GUI framework)
- Many other libraries

**This will take 10-30 minutes depending on your internet speed.**

## Check Progress

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
ps aux | grep "brew install"
```

If you see the process, it's still installing.

## Once Installation Completes

You'll be able to run:

### Option 1: Python Version (Simple, already works)
```bash
python3 live_camera_perception.py --camera 1
```

### Option 2: C++ Fast Version (20+ FPS, requires OpenCV)
```bash
make -f Makefile.fast_vision
./demo_fast_vision 0 20
```

## Alternative: Run Without Camera

While waiting, you can test the system with static images:

```bash
# Download a test image
curl -L "https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg" -o test_image.jpg

# Run YOLO detection
python3 melvin/io/detect_objects.py test_image.jpg

# This will show detected objects in JSON format
```

## If Installation Hangs

If the brew process seems stuck for more than 30 minutes:

```bash
# Kill the process
pkill -9 brew

# Clean up
brew cleanup

# Retry
brew install opencv
```

---

**Expected completion**: ~15-20 minutes from now
**Then**: Ready to run fast vision system at 20+ FPS!
