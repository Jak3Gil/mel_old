   - Blue LED confirms data transmission

3. **Motor Hardware** ‚úì
   - Powered correctly (12V 80A supply)
   - LEDs correct (Solid Red + Blinking Blue = Ready)
   - Responds to all CAN commands
   - Free to rotate (no mechanical issues)

4. **Software Stack** ‚úì
   - Python control code complete
   - Multiple test scripts ready
   - Diagnostic tools working
   - Reset procedures documented

## ‚ùå Current Blocker

**Motor won't execute position commands**

### What We Know:
- Motor receives CAN commands ‚úì
- Motor acknowledges commands ‚úì
- Motor returns responses ‚úì
- But won't actually move ‚úó

### Why:
Motor firmware requires **Position Control Mode** to be activated via:
- Robstride PC Software (Servo Studio), OR
- Robstride Mobile App, OR
- Special initialization sequence we don't have

### The Problem:
Servo Studio won't connect to the motor on your PC.

## üéØ Current Solution Path

**Fix Servo Studio Connection:**

1. Install correct USB-CAN adapter drivers
2. Try all COM ports systematically
3. Try different baudrates (1M, 500k, 250k)
4. Try different protocols (SLCAN, CANopen)
5. Restart computer after driver install
6. Close all other programs using the port

See: `FIX_SERVO_STUDIO_CONNECTION.md` for detailed steps

## üî¨ What We Tested

### Confirmed Working:
‚úì USB-CAN adapter sends data (blue LED)
‚úì Motor on CAN ID 0x01
‚úì Motor responds to Enable command
‚úì Motor responds to Disable command
‚úì Motor responds to Zero Position command
‚úì Motor responds to Position commands
‚úì CANH/CANL wiring correct
‚úì Power supply adequate

### Confirmed NOT Working:
‚úó Position commands don't cause movement
‚úó Servo Studio won't connect
‚úó Can't activate position mode via CAN alone

### Response Pattern:
Motor always returns: `ffffffff7fff...` (mostly FF bytes)
This typically means: "Command received but can't execute"

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (You):
1. **Fix Servo Studio connection** (see guide)
2. **Or try Robstride mobile app** (if exists)
3. **Or contact Robstride support** (email template provided)
4. **Or try on different computer** (Windows might work better)

### Once Connected:
1. Use Servo Studio to enable Position Mode
2. Save configuration to motor
3. Test motor moves in Servo Studio
4. Then run: `python3 test_obvious_movement.py`
5. If works: Your Python code is ready! ‚úì

---

## üíª Ready-to-Use Commands

### Test motor (after mode enabled):
```bash
python3 test_obvious_movement.py
python3 example_kscale_usage.py 1
python3 test_kscale_approach.py
```

### Diagnostics:
```bash
python3 show_can_traffic.py        # Watch CAN bus
python3 scan_can_id.py              # Find motor ID
python3 test_with_can_feedback.py  # Check responses
```

### Your Code Template:
```python
from motor_factory import MotorFactory

motor = MotorFactory.create_from_file('motor_config.yaml', 'main_motor')
motor.connect()
motor.enable()
motor.calibrate()

# Move motor
motor.set_position(1.0)  # 1 radian

motor.disable()
motor.disconnect()
```
