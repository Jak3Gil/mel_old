# 🎯 Attention-Based Vision Integration - COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Integrated  
**Date:** October 17, 2025

---

## What Was Added

Integrated sophisticated **attention-based vision system** into unified Melvin, replacing simple frame capture with human-like visual attention.

### New File: `attention_vision_capture.py`

Advanced vision system with:
- ✅ **Pinpoint attention** - ONE focus at a time (like human vision)
- ✅ **Object tracking** - Recognizes same objects across frames (IoU matching)
- ✅ **Attention shifting** - Smooth, prioritized focus transitions
- ✅ **Persistence** - Maintains state across calls via pickle
- ✅ **Weighted edges** - Reinforces repeatedly seen objects

---

## How It Works

### Attention Mechanism

```
Frame 1: Detect all objects → Find centers → Prioritize → Focus on ONE
Frame 2: Same objects? → Track with IoU → Reinforce connection
Frame 3: New object? → Create new tracked node
Frame 4: Old object not seen? → Keep in memory (up to 10 frames)
```

### Object Tracking

Each detected object gets:
- **node_id**: Unique identifier (persists across frames)
- **action**: "new" or "reinforced"  
- **count**: How many times seen
- **is_focus**: Currently in attention focus
- **bbox**: Bounding box for IoU matching

### State Persistence

State file: `/tmp/melvin_attention_state.pkl`

Stores:
- Tracked objects (label → metadata)
- Attention index (where we're looking)
- Previous focus point (for smooth tracking)
- Frame counter

---

## Advantages Over Simple Detection

| Feature | Simple Detection | Attention-Based |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Tracking** | No | ✅ Yes (IoU matching) |
| **Focus** | All objects equal | ✅ ONE at a time |
| **Reuse** | Creates new every time | ✅ Reinforces existing |
| **Attention** | Random | ✅ Prioritized & smooth |
| **State** | Stateless | ✅ Persistent across frames |
| **Edges** | Simple count | ✅ Weighted reinforcement |

## Output Format

### Example JSON Output

```json
[
  {
    "label": "person",
    "confidence": 0.86,
    "x1": 100,
    "y1": 50,
    "x2": 400,
    "y2": 600,
    "node_id": 0,
    "action": "new",
    "count": 1,
    "is_focus": true
  },
  {
    "label": "bottle",
    "confidence": 0.72,
    "x1": 500,
    "y1": 200,
    "x2": 550,
    "y2": 350,
    "node_id": 1,
    "action": "reinforced",
    "count": 5,
    "is_focus": false
  }
]
```

### Field Meanings

- **node_id**: Unique identifier for this tracked object
- **action**: 
  - `"new"` - First time seeing this object
  - `"reinforced"` - Same object from previous frames
- **count**: How many frames this object has been seen
- **is_focus**: This object is currently in attention focus

## C++ Integration

### Enhanced Output Display

```
[Frame 50] 🎯 Attention vision... 👁️ 2 objects (+1 new) (↑1 tracked) [🎯 1 in focus]
      person (86%)
      bottle (72%)
```

**Indicators:**
- `+N new` - New objects detected
- `↑N tracked` - Objects being tracked (reinforced)
- `🎯 N in focus` - Objects currently in attention focus

---

## Example Attention Flow

### Scenario: Person enters scene with dog

```
Frame 1:
  Detect: person (conf=0.85)
  Action: Create node_id=0, action="new", count=1, is_focus=true
  Output: 👁️ 1 objects (+1 new) [🎯 1 in focus]

Frame 2:
  Detect: person (conf=0.87), dog (conf=0.76)
  Match: person → IoU=0.85 → SAME OBJECT!
  Action: node_id=0, action="reinforced", count=2, is_focus=true
         node_id=1, action="new", count=1, is_focus=false
  Output: 👁️ 2 objects (+1 new) (↑1 tracked) [🎯 1 in focus]

Frame 3:
  Detect: person (conf=0.90), dog (conf=0.80)
  Match: Both tracked!
  Action: node_id=0, count=3, is_focus=false
          node_id=1, count=2, is_focus=true (attention shifted!)
  Output: 👁️ 2 objects (↑2 tracked) [🎯 1 in focus]

Frame 10:
  Detect: Only person (dog left scene)
  Match: person → count=10
  Note: dog still in memory (< 10 frames ago)
  Output: 👁️ 1 objects (↑1 tracked)

Frame 20:
  Detect: Only person
  Note: dog removed from tracking (>10 frames missing)
  Output: 👁️ 1 objects (↑1 tracked)
```

## Graph Integration

### How Tracking Affects the Graph

**Without Tracking:**
```
Frame 1: person → Create node "object:person:1"
Frame 2: person → Create node "object:person:2" (duplicate!)
Frame 3: person → Create node "object:person:3" (triplicate!)
Result: 3 nodes for same object
```

**With Attention Tracking:**
```
Frame 1: person → Create node "object:person" (node_id=0)
Frame 2: person → REINFORCE "object:person" (count=2, weight++)
Frame 3: person → REINFORCE "object:person" (count=3, weight++)
Result: 1 node with strong weight
```

### Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Fewer duplicate nodes
2. **Connection Strength**: Weights increase with repeated observations
3. **Object Permanence**: Same object = same node
4. **Realistic**: Matches human perception (we track objects, not create new concepts)

---

## Configuration

### Tracking Parameters

In `attention_vision_capture.py`:

```python
# IoU threshold for matching (0.3 = 30% overlap)
iou_threshold = 0.3

# How many frames to keep missing objects
max_missing_frames = 10

# YOLO confidence threshold
confidence = 0.3
```

### Attention Parameters

```python
# Prioritize points near previous focus (smooth tracking)
prioritized_points = prioritize_attention_points(centers, prev_focus)

# Focus on ONE object at a time
focus_point = prioritized_points[attention_index % len(prioritized_points)]
```

---

## Performance

### Tracking Efficiency

From test run:
```
Events processed: 17
Nodes created: 2
Nodes reused: 15
Node reuse rate: 88.2%
```

**88% reuse rate!** 
- Without tracking: Would create 17 nodes
- With tracking: Created only 2 nodes, reused 15 times
- **8.5x more efficient**

## Comparison with Original Python Version

### Original `melvin_attention_vision.py`

- ✅ Attention mechanism
- ✅ Object tracking
- ✅ Weighted edges
- ❌ Required OpenCV window (blocking)
- ❌ Can't integrate into C++ main loop
- ❌ Separate from unified system

### New `attention_vision_capture.py`

- ✅ Attention mechanism (preserved)
- ✅ Object tracking (preserved)
- ✅ Weighted edges (preserved)
- ✅ No window required (headless)
- ✅ Integrates into C++ via subprocess
- ✅ Part of unified Melvin system
- ✅ State persistence via pickle
- ✅ JSON output for easy parsing

---

## Running Melvin with Attention Vision

```bash
# Run unified Melvin
./melvin_unified

# You'll see:
🎯 Attention vision... 👁️ 2 objects (+1 new) (↑1 tracked) [🎯 1 in focus]
      person (85%)
      bottle (70%)
```

### Output Indicators

- **🎯 Attention vision** - Using sophisticated attention system
- **+N new** - New objects discovered
- **↑N tracked** - Objects being tracked across frames
- **[🎯 N in focus]** - Objects currently in attention focus
- **Percentage** - Detection confidence

---

## State Management

### State File Location

`/tmp/melvin_attention_state.pkl`

Contains:
- All tracked objects
- Attention state
- Frame counter

### Clearing State

```bash
# Reset attention state (fresh start)
rm /tmp/melvin_attention_state.pkl
```

This will cause all objects to be "new" again on next run.

## Benefits for Melvin's Brain

### 1. Object Permanence
Like humans, Melvin understands that the same object seen repeatedly is ONE object, not multiple.

### 2. Attention Focus
Melvin focuses on ONE thing at a time, then shifts attention (human-like).

### 3. Memory Efficiency  
88% reuse rate = much smaller knowledge graph = faster reasoning.

### 4. Stronger Connections
Repeated observations strengthen weights automatically.

### 5. Smooth Tracking
Attention prioritizes nearby objects (smooth, not jumpy).

---

## Advanced Features

### 1. IoU-Based Matching

```python
iou = compute_iou(current_bbox, tracked_bbox)
if iou > 0.3:  # 30% overlap
    # Same object! Reinforce it
```

### 2. Temporal Memory

Objects stay in memory for 10 frames after disappearing (object permanence).

### 3. Attention Prioritization

```python
# Prefer objects near previous focus (smooth tracking)
if prev_focus:
    points = sorted(points, key=distance_from_prev_focus)
```

### 4. One Focus at a Time

```python
# Cycle through detected objects
focus_point = prioritized_points[attention_index % len(prioritized_points)]
attention_index += 1
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- [ ] Velocity tracking (predict where objects will move)
- [ ] Salience detection (focus on interesting/unusual objects)
- [ ] Gaze patterns (human-like scanning)
- [ ] Object relationships (spatial reasoning)
- [ ] Multi-level attention (foreground vs background)

---

## Summary

✅ **Integrated** sophisticated attention-based vision  
✅ **Tracking** objects across frames (88% reuse rate)  
✅ **Attention** ONE focus at a time (human-like)  
✅ **Persistent** state across calls  
✅ **Efficient** memory usage  
✅ **Weighted** edges strengthen automatically
