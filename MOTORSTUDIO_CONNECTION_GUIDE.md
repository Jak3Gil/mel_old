# Motor Studio Connection Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Hardware Verified:**
- COM3 available (USB-SERIAL CH340)
- COM port not in use
- Motor Studio configured correctly
- No software conflicts

❌ **Problem:** Motor Studio won't connect to motor

## Root Cause

This happens when:
1. Motor firmware state is stuck from previous sessions
2. CAN bus needs reset
3. Motor needs fresh power cycle

## Solution: Full Device Reset

### Option 1: Run the Automated Script (EASIEST)

Double-click: `prepare_motorstudio_connection.bat`

Follow the on-screen instructions - it will guide you through each step.

---

### Option 2: Manual Steps

#### Step 1: Full Reset
1. **Close Motor Studio** (if open)
2. **Unplug USB-CAN adapter** from PC
3. **Turn OFF motor power** (12V supply)
4. **Wait 10 seconds** (let everything discharge)
5. **Turn ON motor power** (12V supply)
   - Check LEDs: Should be **Solid Red + Blinking Blue**
6. **Wait 5 seconds**
7. **Plug in USB-CAN adapter** to PC
8. **Wait 5 seconds** (let Windows recognize device)

#### Step 2: Open Motor Studio
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\motorstudio0.0.8\motorstudio0.0.8\`
2. Double-click: `motorstudio.exe`

#### Step 3: Connection Settings
In Motor Studio:
- **COM Port:** Select `COM3` from dropdown
- **Baudrate:** `921600` (should be default)
- **Protocol:** Try `SLCAN` first, then `L91` if needed

#### Step 4: Connect
1. Click **"Connect"** or **"Scan"** button
2. Wait 5-10 seconds
3. Motor should be detected

#### Step 5: If Connected Successfully
You should see:
- Motor status displayed
- Real-time position/velocity readings
- Green "Connected" indicator
- Motor parameters visible

## If Still Not Connecting

### Try Different Baudrate
Motor Studio might need a different baudrate:

Try these in order:
1. **921600** (current setting)
2. **1000000** (1 Mbps)
3. **500000** (500 kbps)
4. **115200** (SLCAN standard)

**How to change:**
- In Motor Studio, look for baudrate dropdown
- Or edit config: `motorstudio0.0.8\config.xml`
- Change: `<c name="baud_rate" type="4" value="921600"/>` to different value

### Try Different Protocol
- SLCAN
- L91
- CANopen (unlikely but worth trying)

### Check Motor LEDs
**Correct state:** Solid Red + Blinking Blue
- If different, motor needs power cycle
- If no LEDs, check 12V power supply

### Check Device Manager
1. Press `Win + X`
2. Select **Device Manager**
3. Expand **Ports (COM & LPT)**
4. Find: **USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM3)**
5. Right-click → **Properties**
6. Check: **"This device is working properly"**

If not working properly:
- Right-click → **Uninstall device**
- Unplug adapter
- Plug back in
- Windows will reinstall driver

## Understanding the Motor Studio Interface

Once connected, you should see:

### Main Panel
- **Motor Status:** Connected/Disconnected
- **Position:** Current position (radians or degrees)
- **Velocity:** Current velocity
- **Torque:** Current torque
- **Temperature:** Motor temperature

### Settings/Configuration Tab
Look for:
- **Control Mode** or **Operating Mode**
- **Position Mode** or **MIT Mode** ← **THIS IS WHAT WE NEED!**

### How to Enable Position Mode

1. **Find Mode Setting:**
   - Look for dropdown labeled "Mode", "Control Mode", or "Operating Mode"
   - Current value might be: "CANopen", "Idle", "Velocity", etc.

2. **Change to Position Mode:**
   - Select: **"Position"**, **"MIT"**, or **"Servo Mode"**

3. **CRITICAL: Save to Motor**
   - Look for button: **"Save"**, **"Write to Motor"**, **"Apply"**, or **"Commit"**
   - Click it!
   - Motor may restart briefly (LEDs blink)

4. **Verify:**
   - Mode should now show as "Position" or "MIT"
   - Try moving motor using position slider/control
   - Motor shaft should physically move

5. **Test Movement:**
   - Use position control slider
   - Try moving to 0.5 radians
   - Motor should move smoothly
   - Try moving to -0.5 radians
   - Motor should move back

---

## After Position Mode is Enabled

### Close Motor Studio
Once position mode is enabled and saved:
- You can close Motor Studio
- Mode is saved permanently in motor firmware
- Motor will stay in position mode forever (until you change it again)

### Test with Python
Run the test script:
```bash
cd E:\melvin_github\Melvin
python example_kscale_usage.py 1
```

**Expected result:** Motor should move!

### If Python Works
Congratulations! Everything is now working:
- Motor control architecture ready
- Position mode enabled
- Python control functional
- Ready for advanced robotics work

## Motor Studio Versions

If current version (0.0.8) continues to have issues:

### Check for Updates
- Contact Robstride support
- Ask for latest Motor Studio version
- Mention you have version 0.0.8

### Try Older Version
- Sometimes older versions work better
- Ask Robstride for version 0.0.7 or 0.0.6

```
Subject: Motor Studio 0.0.8 Won't Connect - COM3 Available

Hello Robstride Support,

I have Motor Studio v0.0.8 and a Robstride 03 motor (CAN ID 0x01).

Motor Studio won't connect even though:
- COM3 is available and working
- Motor is powered (LEDs: Red + Blinking Blue)  
- Baudrate set to 921600
- Motor previously connected but stopped working

Tried:
- Full power cycle of motor and adapter
- Multiple baudrates (921600, 1000000, 115200)
- Different protocols (SLCAN, L91)
- Fresh restart of everything

Questions:
1. What are the exact connection settings for Motor Studio 0.0.8?
2. Is there a connection guide or video tutorial?
3. Could this be a version compatibility issue?
4. Is there a newer/older version I should try?

Motor Model: Robstride 03
CAN ID: 0x01
Adapter: USB-SERIAL CH340 (COM3)
OS: Windows 11

Thank you!
```
