## 🎯 Key Innovations Implemented

### 1. Graph Context Injection
Sequence predictor accepts graph activations from GNN, biasing token predictions toward factually grounded outputs.

### 2. Hybrid Probability Fusion
```cpp
P(next) = α * P_graph(next) + β * P_sequence(next)
```
Where α=0.6 (facts) and β=0.4 (fluency) by default.

### 3. Graph Gating
Output tokens must have minimum graph support (default 0.1) or they're suppressed, preventing hallucinations.

### 4. Episodic Temporal Memory
Every EXACT edge chain is timestamped and grouped into episodes, enabling true temporal reasoning.

### 5. Autonomous Exploration
System identifies knowledge gaps (high-degree nodes without LEAPs) and explores them automatically.
