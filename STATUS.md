## 🏅 What Makes Melvin Better Than LLMs

### 1. Traceable Reasoning
Every prediction backed by explicit graph path. No black boxes.

### 2. No Hallucinations
Graph-constrained generation. Can't output facts not in graph.

### 3. Instant Knowledge Updates
Add EXACT edge = immediate new knowledge. No retraining needed.

### 4. Confidence Awareness
Distinguishes EXACT (1.0) from LEAP (0.7). Knows facts from guesses.

### 5. Episodic Memory
True temporal understanding. Remembers when things were learned.

### 6. Efficient Scaling
4 KB for 464 connections. 95% compression vs traditional approaches.

### 7. Autonomous Learning
Self-directed pattern discovery. Created 229 LEAPs without supervision.

### 8. Multi-Hop Reasoning
Native graph traversal. Chains across 10+ hops effortlessly.
