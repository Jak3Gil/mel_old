# Try Lingzustudio as Alternative

## 🎯 What We Found

Someone else trying to connect to Robstride motor used **Lingzustudio** (灵族工作室) instead of Robstride Motor Studio.

**Key finding:** Their config has `upload_param_on_connected="true"` which might help initialize the motor!

## 🚀 Quick Test

### **Step 1: Run Lingzustudio**

Navigate to:
```
C:\Users\Owner\Downloads\Studio (1)\Studio\╔╧╬╗╗·\┴Θ╫π0.0.2\
```

Double-click: `Lingzustudio.exe`

### **Step 2: Connection Settings**

In Lingzustudio:
- **COM Port:** COM4
- **Baudrate:** 921600 (should be default)
- **Motor ID:** 1
- Click "Connect" or "扫描" (Scan)

### **Step 3: Look for Position Mode**

If it connects, look for:
- "Position Mode" or "位置模式"
- "MIT Mode" or "MIT模式"
- Mode dropdown or tabs

Enable it and save!

## 🤔 Why This Might Work

1. **Different initialization sequence** - Might send commands in different order
2. **`upload_param_on_connected`** - Automatically configures motor on connect
3. **Different protocol handling** - May be more forgiving
4. **Chinese motor compatibility** - Some motors are better supported by Chinese software

## ⚠️ Reality Check

If motor firmware is truly stuck (not responding at CAN level), even Lingzustudio won't help.

**But worth trying because:**
- Takes 2 minutes
- Different software = different init sequence
- Might wake up stuck motor
- You already have it!

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

**Best case:** 
- Lingzustudio connects!
- Motor responds
- Enable position mode
- Everything works!

**Most likely:**
- Same error (can't connect)
- Confirms motor firmware issue
- Wait for Robstride support

**Worst case:**
- Software crashes/errors
- No worse than before

## ✅ Try It Now!

1. Close Robstride Motor Studio (if open)
2. Run `Lingzustudio.exe`
3. Select COM4
4. Click Connect
5. Report what happens!

Worth a 2-minute test!
