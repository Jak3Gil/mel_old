# Robstride Motor Status

## ‚úÖ What's WORKING:

1. **USB-CAN Adapter**: ‚úì Connected and communicating
2. **CAN Communication**: ‚úì L91 protocol working
3. **Motor Responding**: ‚úì Getting 17-20 byte responses from motor
4. **Wiring**: ‚úì CANH, CANL, GND connected correctly
5. **Python Code**: ‚úì Commands being sent properly

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working:

1. **Motor NOT Moving Physically**: Motor shaft doesn't rotate

## üîç Diagnosis:

**Motor is in WRONG MODE or NEEDS CONFIGURATION**

The motor is:
- Receiving our commands ‚úì
- Sending acknowledgements ‚úì
- BUT not executing position commands ‚úó

This means: **Motor is likely in CANopen mode or needs MIT mode enabled**

## üéØ SOLUTION:

### You MUST use Robstride PC Software to:

1. **Open Robstride PC Software**
2. **Connect to motor** (make sure it connects successfully)
3. **Look for these settings:**
   - Motor Mode / Control Mode
   - Protocol Selection
   - Operating Mode
4. **Switch to one of these:**
   - "MIT Mode"
   - "Position Control Mode"  
   - "Servo Mode"
   - (NOT "CANopen" or "Fieldbus")
5. **Look for these features:**
   - "Calibrate Encoder" - RUN THIS
   - "Clear Faults" - RUN THIS
   - "Enable Motor" or "Motor ON"
6. **Test in PC software:**
   - Try to move motor using their position slider/control
   - **Does it move in PC software?**

### Once Motor Moves in PC Software:

Then Python will work! The motor just needs to be configured/calibrated first.

## üìã PC Software Checklist:

When you open PC software, look for and tell me:

- [ ] Does motor connect successfully?
- [ ] What "Mode" is motor in? (MIT/CANopen/Servo/etc)
- [ ] Is there a "Motor Status" display?
- [ ] Any error messages or fault codes?
- [ ] Can you move motor using PC software controls?
- [ ] Is there an "Encoder Calibration" option?

## üí° Why This Happens:

Robstride motors can operate in different modes:
- **CANopen Mode**: Industrial fieldbus (complex protocol)
- **MIT Mode**: Simple position control (what we want)
- **Torque Mode**: Direct torque control
- **Velocity Mode**: Speed control

**Our Python code uses MIT protocol**, so motor must be in MIT mode to respond to position commands.

## üöÄ Next Steps:

1. Close Python/Terminal
2. Open Robstride PC software
3. Configure motor to MIT/Position mode
4. Test motor moves in PC software
5. Once working, Python will work too!

The hardware is 100% working - just needs software configuration! üéØ
