# 5. Learning Chemistry (LEAP + Weight Updates)

**Pipeline Stage: Synaptic plasticity and learning**

This directory contains all components that strengthen connections through experience.

## Components

### Core Learning
- `fast_learning.cpp/h` - Fast learning algorithms
- `learning.cpp/h` - General learning mechanisms
- `autonomous_learner.cpp/h` - Self-directed learning

### LEAP System
- `leap_inference.cpp/h` - LEAP pattern inference
- `leap_synthesis.cpp/h` - LEAP pattern synthesis

### Adaptive Mechanisms
- `adaptive_weighting.cpp/h` - Dynamic weight adjustment
- `adaptive_window.h` - Adaptive context window
- `adaptive_window_config.h` - Window configuration
- `ADAPTIVE_WINDOW_README.md` - Documentation

### Data Management
- `dataset_loader.cpp/h` - Training data loading

## Principles
- **LEAP learning** - Local Exponential Activation Potentiation
- **Hebbian reinforcement** - Neurons that fire together wire together
- **Adaptive windows** - Context-sensitive learning rates
- **Weight decay** - Unused connections weaken over time

## Flow
Active Context (Stage 4) → Learning → Updated Weights → Better Predictions (Stage 6)
