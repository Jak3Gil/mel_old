Each stage modifies the context of the next. Reasoning **guides** attention through feedback.

## 📊 Stage-by-Stage Breakdown

### 1️⃣ **INPUT LAYER**
**File:** Raw sensory data  
**Purpose:** Capture all available information

```cpp
SensoryFrame {
    visual_candidates   // Camera frames → regions
    audio_candidates    // Microphone → sounds
    battery_level      // Internal state
    current_goal       // Task context
}
```

**Sources:**
- 📷 Vision: `advanced_attention_vision.py`
- 🎤 Audio: `AudioPipeline` (PortAudio)
- 🔋 Internal: System sensors

---

### 2️⃣ **PERCEPTION LAYER**
**File:** `UnifiedMind::perception_stage()`  
**Purpose:** Transform raw input into focus candidates

**Process:**
```cpp
For each sensory input:
    1. Extract visual/audio features
    2. Compute raw scores (A, R, N, T, C)
    3. Tag with memory IDs
    4. Apply feedback biases from previous thoughts
```

**Output:** `vector<FocusCandidate>` with enhanced scores

**Key Feature:** 
```cpp
// Apply reasoning feedback to perception
for (candidate in candidates):
    if (candidate.label matches thought.keywords):
        candidate.R += feedback_bias  // Boost relevance!
```

---

### 3️⃣ **ATTENTION LAYER**
**File:** `AttentionManager` + `UnifiedMind::attention_stage()`  
**Purpose:** Select ONE focus target using weighted formula

**Formula:**
```
F = (A × 0.40) + (R × 0.30) + (N × 0.20) + (T × 0.05) + (C × 0.05)
  + context_biases
  + persistence_bonus
  - inhibition_penalty
  + inertia_bonus
```

**Advanced Features:**
- ✅ **Historical Inertia**: Switch only if `F_new > F_current × 1.15`
- ✅ **Softmax Selection**: `P_i = exp(F_i/τ) / Σexp(F_j/τ)` with `τ=0.2`
- ✅ **Inhibition of Return**: Suppress recently focused objects
- ✅ **Persistence Tracking**: Objects tracked for 30+ frames get bonus
- ✅ **Prediction Error**: Motion ≠ expected → curiosity spike

**Output:** `FocusTarget` (ONE object per cycle)

---

### 4️⃣ **REASONING LAYER**
**File:** `UnifiedMind::reasoning_stage()`  
**Purpose:** Interpret focus and generate structured thought

**Process:**
```cpp
1. Query AtomicGraph for related concepts
2. Find strongest connections to focused object
3. Generate: subject + predicate + object
4. Extract keywords for feedback
```

**Example:**
```
FocusTarget: object_5 (high curiosity, motion detected)
Graph neighbors: "person", "animal"
→ Thought: "object_5 moves_unexpectedly person"
Keywords: ["motion", "curiosity", "person"]
```

**Output:** `Thought` struct with subject-predicate-object triple

---

### 5️⃣ **OUTPUT LAYER**
**File:** `UnifiedMind::output_stage()`  
**Purpose:** Express thought as text/speech

**Process:**
```cpp
Thought → Natural language sentence
"I moves_unexpectedly object_5 (person)"
→ "I see object_5 moving (related to person)"
```

**Channels:**
- 📝 Text: Terminal output
- 🔊 Speech: TTS via `say` command (optional)
- 🧠 Internal: Monologue for self-reflection

**Output:** `OutputExpression` with text + emotional tone

---

### 6️⃣ **FEEDBACK LAYER**
**File:** `FeedbackBus` + `UnifiedMind::feedback_stage()`  
**Purpose:** Close the loop - reasoning guides next perception

**Feedback Actions:**

#### A. Bias Attention
```cpp
If thought contained "person":
    → Next cycle: boost R for objects labeled "person"
    → Attention becomes MEANING-AWARE
```

#### B. Reinforce Memory
```cpp
Create/strengthen edges in AtomicGraph:
    subject ←(CO_OCCURS_WITH)→ object
    prev_focus ←(TEMPORAL_NEXT)→ current_focus
```

#### C. Update Motivation
```cpp
Keywords → adjust attention weights:
    "curiosity" → increase wC
    "danger" → increase wN (need)
    "task" → increase wR (relevance)
```

**This is where cognition becomes **self-modifying**!**

---

### 7️⃣ **MEMORY LAYER**
**File:** `AtomicGraph`  
**Purpose:** Persistent knowledge accumulation

**Structure:**
```
Nodes:
    - object_0, object_1, ... (sensory)
    - person, fire, heat, ... (concepts)

Edges:
    - EXACT (co-occurrence)
    - TEMPORAL_NEXT (sequence)
    - INSTANCE_OF (category)
```

**Growth:**
- Every focused object → node created/reinforced
- Objects appearing together → EXACT edges
- Sequential focus → TEMPORAL edges
- Reasoning links → concept edges

## 🔁 Complete Cycle Example

### Frame 100:
```
1. INPUT:
   Camera sees: 2 visual regions
   Microphone: silence
   State: battery 80%, exploring mode

2. PERCEPTION:
   Candidate A: object_3 (center, high edges)
   Candidate B: object_7 (periphery, low edges)
   Apply feedback: "object_3" was in last thought
   → object_3.R boosted by +0.15

3. ATTENTION:
   object_3: F = 0.65 (base) + 0.15 (bias) + 0.10 (persistence) = 0.90
   object_7: F = 0.35
   Softmax → 92% probability for object_3
   → FOCUS: object_3

4. REASONING:
   Query graph: object_3 connected to "person" (weight 0.8)
   Generate: Thought {
      subject: "object_3",
      predicate: "persists",
      object: "person",
      keywords: ["stable", "tracked", "person"]
   }

5. OUTPUT:
   Text: "I see object_3 persisting (person)"
   Speech: (optional TTS)

6. FEEDBACK:
   - Add bias: "person" +0.20
   - Add bias: "stable" +0.15
   - Reinforce edge: object_3 ←→ person
   - Create temporal: object_2 → object_3
```

### Frame 101:
```
Perception now BIASED towards "person" concept
If new visual region looks person-like → higher R score!
```

**This is meaning-guided perception!**

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### ✅ 1. Reasoning Guides Attention
Old: Attention = pure sensory salience  
**New**: Attention = salience × context × meaning

### ✅ 2. Thoughts Create Biases
Old: Random focus on bright/loud things  
**New**: Focus on what's relevant to recent thoughts

### ✅ 3. Memory Grows from Experience
Old: Static knowledge base  
**New**: Every cycle adds connections

### ✅ 4. Closed Loop = Learning
Old: One-way pipeline  
**New**: Output feeds back to perception

### ✅ 5. Stable Focus Tracking
Old: Random jumps between objects  
**New**: 15% threshold + persistence tracking

### ✅ 6. Prediction-Based Curiosity
Old: Static curiosity scores  
**New**: Prediction error → curiosity spikes

## 🎓 Advanced Concepts Implemented

### 1. **Predictive Coding**
```cpp
predicted_position = current_pos + velocity
error = |actual - predicted|
C += error × 0.5  // Prediction error → curiosity
```

### 2. **Attention Schema Theory**
```cpp
AttentionManager = model of what Melvin is attending to
Thoughts reference this schema
Creates self-awareness of focus
```

### 3. **Active Inference**
```cpp
Perception shaped by prior beliefs (feedback biases)
Prediction errors drive exploration
Minimizes surprise through learning
```

### 4. **Hebbian Learning**
```cpp
Neurons that fire together, wire together:
object_3 + "person" co-occur → strengthen edge
```

### 5. **Working Memory**
```cpp
focus_history (30 frames) = short-term memory
AtomicGraph = long-term memory
```

## 💡 Key Insight

> **Melvin's perception is shaped by what he thinks about.**

If Melvin thinks about "person":
- Next cycle, objects matching "person" features get +R boost
- Attention becomes **semantically aware**
- Creates **top-down + bottom-up integration**

This is the essence of **unified cognition**!
