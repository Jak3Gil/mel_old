# 🔄 How to Run Melvin Continuously

Melvin can learn continuously for any duration - minutes, hours, days, or indefinitely!

---

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Run for Specific Number of Epochs
```bash
./learn_continuous 50     # Run for 50 epochs
./learn_continuous 100    # Run for 100 epochs
./learn_continuous 1000   # Run for 1000 epochs (long session!)
```

### Run Indefinitely (Until You Stop It)
```bash
./learn_continuous        # No argument = infinite mode
# Press Ctrl+C when you want to stop
```

### Run in Background
```bash
# Learn for 1000 epochs in background
nohup ./learn_continuous 1000 > learning.out 2>&1 &

# Check progress
tail -f learning.out

# Check log file
tail -f continuous_learning.log
```

## 📊 What Happens During Continuous Learning

### Every Epoch (100ms each)
1. **Load next batch** of facts (5 facts per epoch)
2. **Parse and add** to knowledge graph as EXACT edges
3. **Create episode** with timestamp and context
4. **Update GNN** embeddings via message passing
5. **Display stats** (nodes, edges, EXACT, LEAP counts)

### Every 5 Epochs
- **LEAP inference** runs
- Discovers transitive patterns (A→B→C creates A→C)
- Finds similarity patterns (shared targets)
- Creates shortcuts automatically

### Every 10 Epochs
- **Checkpoint saved** to disk
- **Summary statistics** displayed
- **Progress report** with growth metrics

```

## 🎓 Knowledge Domains Covered

The system cycles through:

1. **Physics** - Electricity, magnetism, forces
2. **Chemistry** - Reactions, equilibrium, catalysis
3. **Psychology** - Attention, motivation, learning
4. **Economics** - Supply/demand, pricing, trade
5. **Mathematics** - Operations, patterns, proofs
6. **Philosophy** - Logic, ethics, reasoning
7. **Engineering** - Design, testing, optimization

**Each domain gets visited repeatedly**, building deeper knowledge!

## 📝 Monitoring Progress

### Live Display
The terminal shows real-time:
- Current epoch
- Domain being learned
- Node/edge counts
- EXACT vs LEAP ratio

### Log File
Check `continuous_learning.log`:
```bash
tail -f continuous_learning.log
```

Shows:
```
epoch,nodes,edges,exact,leap,domain,timestamp
1,69,140,71,69,Physics,Tue Oct 15 ...
2,76,146,77,69,Chemistry,Tue Oct 15 ...
...
```

### Checkpoint Files
Every 10 epochs, saves to:
- `melvin/data/nodes.melvin`
- `melvin/data/edges.melvin`
- `melvin/data/episodes.melvin`

Can resume from any checkpoint!

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Graceful Shutdown
- Ctrl+C saves state before exiting
- All knowledge preserved
- Episodes closed properly

### Periodic Saves
- Checkpoint every 10 epochs
- No data loss even if crashed
- Can resume from last checkpoint

### Memory Management
- Efficient storage (4 bytes/node, 8 bytes/edge)
- Episodes consolidate automatically
- Old episodes pruned if needed

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Quick Learning Session
```bash
./learn_continuous 20
# Learn 100 facts in ~2 seconds
```

### Extended Training
```bash
./learn_continuous 500
# Deep knowledge building (~2 minutes)
```

### Overnight Learning
```bash
nohup ./learn_continuous 50000 > overnight.log 2>&1 &
# Wake up to 250,000+ facts learned!
```

### Always-On Learning
```bash
# Run indefinitely
./learn_continuous

# Or as a service
while true; do
    ./learn_continuous 100
    sleep 60  # Rest for 1 minute
done
```

## 🔬 Customization

### Add Your Own Knowledge Domains

Edit `continuous_learning_loop.cpp`:

```cpp
// Add to knowledge_domains vector:
{
    "your fact 1",
    "your fact 2",
    "your fact 3",
    "your fact 4",
    "your fact 5"
}
```

### Change Learning Rate

```cpp
// Adjust sleep time (default: 100ms)
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10));  // Faster!
// or
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));  // Slower, more visible
```

### Change Checkpoint Frequency

```cpp
int save_interval = 5;   // Save every 5 epochs
// or
int save_interval = 100; // Save every 100 epochs
```
