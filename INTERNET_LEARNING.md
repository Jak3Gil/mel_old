## 🔧 How It Works

### Step 1: Fetch (Python)
```
internet_knowledge_fetcher.py
    ↓
Tries Wikipedia API
    ↓
Falls back to local generation
    ↓
Saves to: internet_facts.txt
```

### Step 2: Feed (C++)
```
feed_internet_knowledge
    ↓
Reads internet_facts.txt
    ↓
Parses into concept chains
    ↓
Creates EXACT edges
    ↓
Creates episode
    ↓
Runs LEAP inference
    ↓
Saves to knowledge base
```

## 📈 Scalability

### Small Scale (Quick Test)
```bash
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 100
./feed_internet_knowledge
```
- **Time:** < 5 seconds
- **Growth:** +25 nodes, +1,600 edges

### Medium Scale (Good Growth)
```bash
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 1000
./feed_internet_knowledge
```
- **Time:** ~30 seconds
- **Expected:** +200 nodes, +10,000 edges

### Large Scale (Massive Knowledge)
```bash
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 10000
./feed_internet_knowledge
```
- **Time:** ~5 minutes
- **Expected:** +2,000 nodes, +50,000+ edges

## 🔄 Continuous Internet Learning

### Option 1: Periodic Fetching
```bash
# Fetch and learn every hour
while true; do
    python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 500
    ./feed_internet_knowledge
    sleep 3600  # 1 hour
done
```

### Option 2: Scheduled (Cron)
```bash
# Add to crontab
0 * * * * cd /path/to/Melvin && python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 100 && ./feed_internet_knowledge
```

### Option 3: On-Demand
```bash
# Fetch when you want fresh knowledge
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 500
./feed_internet_knowledge
```

## 🛠️ Customizing Sources

### Add More Wikipedia Topics

Edit `internet_knowledge_fetcher.py`:

```python
wiki_topics = [
    "Artificial Intelligence",
    "Machine Learning",
    "Neuroscience",
    "Biology",
    "Physics",
    "Chemistry",
    # Add hundreds more!
]
```

### Add RSS Feeds

```python
# In fetch_all() method, add:
rss_feeds = [
    "https://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Science.xml",
    "https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/rss.xml",
    "https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss"
]

for feed in rss_feeds:
    facts = self.fetch_rss_feed(feed)
    all_facts.extend(facts)
```

### Add Custom Web Pages

```python
# Fetch from any public webpage
facts = fetcher.fetch_simple_facts("https://example.com/knowledge.html")
```

---

## 📊 Growth Tracking

After each internet learning session:

```bash
# See what was learned
./inspect_kb

# Test reasoning
./test_reasoning

# Ask questions
cd melvin && ./melvin
```

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
```bash
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 50
./feed_internet_knowledge
```

### 2. Check Results
```bash
./inspect_kb  # See nodes and edges
tail internet_facts.txt  # See what was fetched
```

### 3. Scale Up Gradually
```bash
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 200
./feed_internet_knowledge
# Check again
./inspect_kb
```

### 4. Diversify Sources
- Mix Wikipedia + RSS + generated facts
- Different topics each time
- Rotate through domains

---

## 🎯 Example Workflow

```bash
# Morning: Learn from science
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 200
# Edit to focus on science topics
./feed_internet_knowledge

# Afternoon: Learn from technology
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 200
# Edit to focus on tech topics
./feed_internet_knowledge

# Evening: Learn from philosophy
python3 internet_knowledge_fetcher.py 200
# Edit to focus on philosophy topics
./feed_internet_knowledge

# Result: 600 facts learned across multiple domains!
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Fact Parsing

Input (from internet):
```
"neurons transmit signals across synapses"
```

Parsed to:
```
neurons → transmit → signals → across → synapses
```

Creates:
- 5 nodes (if new)
- 4 EXACT edges
- Plus LEAP shortcuts discovered later

### LEAP Creation Example

After learning:
```
neurons → transmit → signals
signals → carry → information
```

LEAP inference creates:
```
neurons --[LEAP]--> information
```

**Automatic pattern discovery!**
