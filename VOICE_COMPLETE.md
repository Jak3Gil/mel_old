## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

### With Audio Subsystem
```python
from melvin.core.input_manager import InputManager
from melvin.io.text_to_speech import speak

manager = InputManager()
manager.init()

# Get audio events
events = manager.get_audio_events()

# Respond to events
for event in events:
    if event.type == "speech":
        speak(f"I heard: {event.label}")
```

### With Knowledge Graph
```python
from melvin.core.atomic_graph import AtomicGraph
from melvin.io.text_to_speech import speak

graph = AtomicGraph()
graph.load("nodes.bin", "edges.bin")

# Query and speak results
nodes = graph.find_nodes("stove")
speak(f"I found {len(nodes)} concepts about stoves")
```
