## üéØ Patch Pack E Goals

### Problems to Solve

1. **Shallow reasoning** - Currently 1-hop only
   - Target: 3-hop beam search
   - Fix: "cats ‚Üí milk" should work (cats‚Üímammals‚Üímilk)

2. **Memory leaks** - 70% retention = 30% forgotten
   - Target: Realistic forgetting curve
   - Fix: Ebbinghaus decay + spaced repetition

3. **No path verification** - Answer correct but reasoning wrong
   - Target: Verify reasoning path matches expected
   - Fix: DERIVE specs + path class checking

4. **Weight drift** - Re-teaching over-inflates weights
   - Target: Capped, stable weights
   - Fix: EdgeKey + utility tracking + w_max cap

5. **No generalization** - No transfer testing
   - Target: Auto-generate sibling tests
   - Fix: After "cats‚Üímilk", test "dogs‚Üímilk"

### Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Pass rate | 70% | ‚â•85% | +15% |
| Hop capability | 1-hop | 3-hop | Multi-hop |
| "cats‚Üímilk" | ‚ùå FAILS | ‚úÖ PASSES | 2-hop works |
| Weight stability | Drifts | Capped | Controlled |
| Path verification | N/A | ‚â•80% | New metric |

## üß™ Test Plan for Patch Pack E

### Test 1: Multi-Hop Verification

```bash
make teach_reset
make teach FILE=lessons/03_multihop.tch

# Expected:
# "What do cats produce?" ‚Üí "milk" ‚úÖ (was ‚ùå)
# Pass rate: ‚â•80% (was ~30% without multi-hop)
```

### Test 2: SRS + Decay

```bash
# Teach curriculum
make teach_dir DIR=lessons/

# Apply decay
make decay

# Run SRS (due cards only)
make srs

# Expected:
# Some edges weakened (realistic forgetting)
# Only due cards reviewed
# Successful reviews boost weights
```

### Test 3: Path Verification

```bash
make teach FILE=lessons/03_multihop.tch --require-path

# Expected:
# Reports show path_class for each test
# DERIVE specs checked
# Path correctness ‚â•80%
```

### Test 4: Complete System

```bash
make teach_reset
make teach_dir DIR=lessons/  # All 4 lessons (including 03_multihop)

# Expected:
# Pass rate: ‚â•85% (was 70%)
# Multi-hop working
# All DERIVE specs checked
# Growth: 60-70 nodes, 60-70 edges
```

## üí° Quick Start for Next Session

### Option A: Cursor Prompt (Recommended)

Copy this into Cursor:

```
Implement Patch Pack E for Melvin based on PATCH_PACK_E_SPEC.md

Current state:
- Four systems complete (see READY_TO_COMMIT.md)
- Brain: 49 nodes, 48 edges, 70% retention
- Partial work: multihop, edge_decay headers complete

Goal:
- Multi-hop reasoning (k=3)
- SRS scheduler (SM-2 algorithm)
- Edge decay (Ebbinghaus)
- Path verification (DERIVE specs)
- Target: 85%+ retention

Implementation priority:
1. Multi-hop integration (use existing multihop.h/cpp)
2. Path verifier
3. SRS scheduler completion
4. Edge decay tool
5. Format v2 (ALIAS/DERIVE/NEG)
6. Full testing

Start with multi-hop integration into teaching_verify.cpp.
All specifications in PATCH_PACK_E_SPEC.md.
```

### Option B: Manual Implementation

1. Read `PATCH_PACK_E_SPEC.md` (complete design)
2. Start with multi-hop integration (easiest win)
3. Follow implementation order in spec
4. Test incrementally
5. Commit when all tests pass

## üéì Context for Fresh Session

### What Melvin Can Do Now

**After this commit:**
- Measure reasoning (diagnostics)
- Store experiments (database)
- Learn from interactions (edge growth)
- Be taught knowledge (lessons)
- Persist across sessions (snapshots)

**Limitations:**
- Only 1-hop reasoning (shallow)
- No forgetting (memory bloat)
- No path verification (can't explain WHY)
- 70% retention (leaks knowledge)

### What Patch Pack E Adds

**After Patch Pack E:**
- 3-hop reasoning (deep)
- Realistic forgetting (SRS + decay)
- Path verification (explainable)
- 85%+ retention (tighter learning)

**Impact:**
- "cats‚Üímilk" will pass
- Knowledge consolidates
- Retention improves
- Reasoning is explainable

## üéØ Recommended Fresh Session Start

### Prompt to Use

```
Continue Melvin development with Patch Pack E implementation.

- Current retention: 70% average
- Goal: Implement multi-hop + SRS + decay to reach 85%+ retention

Start by:

2. Reviewing existing partial work (multihop.*, edge_decay.*)
3. Implementing remaining components
4. Testing on lessons/03_multihop.tch
5. Verifying 85%+ retention target

Begin with multi-hop integration (highest priority).
