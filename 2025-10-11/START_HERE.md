# 🚀 START HERE - Complete Training & Diagnostic System

## What You Have

A **complete, measurable feedback loop** for training Melvin's graph-guided predictive reasoning system.

**No more guess-and-check.** Every change is quantified. Every improvement is tracked.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Test the system (already done!)
make run_diagnostic_quick

# 2. Check your progress
./weekly_summary.sh

# 3. Plot your journey
python3 plot_progress.py --save
```

## 🎯 The Goal: Context Similarity = 0.5

**This is when coherent, conceptually-driven sentences emerge.**

Current: **0.00** → Target: **0.50** → Ultimate: **0.75+**

## 🎬 Your First Training Session

### Step 1: Run Weekly Summary (Baseline Check)

```bash
./weekly_summary.sh
```

**Shows:** Current metrics, trends, recommendations

### Step 2: Check Qualitative Links (Not Ready Yet)

```bash
./qualitative_check.sh
```

**Will say:** "Wait until similarity > 0.35" (correct!)

### Step 3: Prepare Your First Data

**Option A: Use sample data (demo)**
```bash
# 34 high-quality conversation exchanges included
wc -l sample_dialog_data.txt
# Output: 34 sample_dialog_data.txt
```

**Option B: Use real data**
- TinyChat conversations
- Reddit threads
- Your conversation logs
- Format: One exchange per line (Q&A style)

### Step 4: Begin Data Ingestion

**With sample data (demo):**
```bash
# This will show you the workflow
./ingest_dialog_data.sh sample_dialog_data.txt 10
# (Batch size 10 for demo - use 5000 for real data)
```

**With real data:**
```bash
./ingest_dialog_data.sh my_conversations.txt 5000
# Will run diagnostic every 5000 lines automatically
```

### Step 5: Watch Progress

```bash
# Check current status
./weekly_summary.sh

# Plot trends (if you have matplotlib)
python3 plot_progress.py --save

# When similarity > 0.4
./qualitative_check.sh
```

## 📊 The Three Tools You'll Use Most

### 1. Weekly Summary (Every Monday)

```bash
./weekly_summary.sh
```

**Shows:**
- Rolling averages
- Trend analysis  
- Milestone progress
- Specific recommendations
- Recent history table

**Use this to:** Track overall progress at a glance

### 2. Qualitative Check (When Similarity > 0.4)

```bash
./qualitative_check.sh
```

**Shows:**
- Conceptual link strength for each test pair
- Top predicted tokens
- Link classification (strong/weak/faint/none)
- Specific next steps

**Use this to:** Verify conceptual reasoning is emerging

### 3. Progress Plots (Weekly or at Milestones)

```bash
python3 plot_progress.py --save
```

**Generates:** `melvin_progress.png` with 4 subplots
- Entropy reduction over time
- Context similarity over time  
- Leap success rate over time
- **Entropy vs Similarity (THE KEY PLOT)**

**Use this to:** Detect phase transition (curve flattening)

---

## 🎯 The Curve Flattening (What to Watch For)

On the **Entropy vs Similarity plot** (bottom-right):

**Week 1-3: Diagonal Rise**
```
    E │     ╱
    n │    ╱
    t │   ╱
    r │  ╱
    o │ ╱
    p │╱
    y └──────────
      Similarity
```
Model learning basic patterns

**Week 4-5: THE FLATTENING** ⭐
```
    E │    ─────
    n │   ╱
    t │  ╱
    r │ ╱
    o │╱
    p │
    y └──────────
      Similarity
```
**This is reasoning beginning!**

**Week 6+: Horizontal Movement**
```
    E │    ──────→
    n │
    t │
    r │
    o │
    p │
    y └──────────
      Similarity
```
Reasoning active, refining

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Don't Skip Steps
Each layer builds on the previous:
1. Conversations → Grammar and common sense
2. Facts → Breadth of knowledge
3. Reasoning → Causal understanding
4. Abstracts → Conceptual mastery

### Feed Data Gradually
**5k-10k at a time**, measure between batches:
- Catches quality issues early
- Shows incremental progress
- Identifies what helps most

### The 0.4 Threshold is Special
This is when to **start qualitative checks**:
- Faint conceptual links appear
- Nearest neighbors make sense
- You can see reasoning forming

### The 0.5 Threshold is THE Goal
**Everything changes here:**
- Random → Structured
- Guessing → Reasoning
- Incoherent → Coherent sentences

### The Curve Flattening Tells the Story
When entropy stabilizes while similarity keeps rising:
- Model learned optimal constraint level
- Phase transition from learning to reasoning
- **This is your proof it's working**

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

All systems ready:
- ✅ Diagnostic built and tested
- ✅ Baseline established (0.0 / 0.0 / 0%)
- ✅ Tracking history initialized
- ✅ Weekly summary working
- ✅ Qualitative checker ready
- ✅ Plot script prepared
- ✅ Sample data provided

## 🎯 Your Immediate Next Action

**Choose one:**

### Option A: Demo the Workflow (Recommended First)

```bash
# See the full workflow in action with sample data
./ingest_dialog_data.sh sample_dialog_data.txt 10
```

This will show you:
- How ingestion works
- When diagnostics run
- How results get logged
- What the output looks like

### Option B: Start Real Training

```bash
# Prepare your conversation data (10k+ exchanges)
# Then:
./ingest_dialog_data.sh my_real_conversations.txt 5000
```

This begins your real journey to 0.5.

### Option C: Just Monitor Current State

```bash
# See where you are
./weekly_summary.sh

# Plot current state
python3 plot_progress.py --save
```

## 📞 Quick Help

**Issue:** Script won't run  
**Fix:** `chmod +x scriptname.sh`

**Issue:** Python plotting fails  
**Fix:** `pip3 install pandas matplotlib numpy`

**Issue:** Don't have dialog data yet  
**Fix:** Use `sample_dialog_data.txt` to demo, or see TRAINING_WORKFLOW.md for data sources

**Issue:** Metrics not improving  
**Fix:** Check data quality, run auto-tune, ensure embeddings training

## 🎉 Final Summary

**You have everything you need:**

✅ Diagnostic measures **if** system is working (entropy, similarity, success)  
✅ Auto-tuning finds **optimal** parameters (λ, thresholds, rates)  
✅ Tracking shows **when** improvements happen (history log)  
✅ Plotting reveals **how** reasoning emerges (curve flattening)  
✅ Qualitative checks verify **what** concepts connect (human validation)  

**The journey from 0.0 to 0.5 is now:**
- Measurable (3 core metrics)
- Trackable (CSV history)
- Visualizable (progress plots)
- Systematic (4-layer strategy)

**Feed data. Measure. Watch the curve flatten. Cross 0.5. Hear coherence emerge.**
