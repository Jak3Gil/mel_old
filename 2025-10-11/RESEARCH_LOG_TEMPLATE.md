## 🎯 Special Milestone Templates

### Milestone 1: 0.35 Similarity Template

```markdown
## Entry [N] - MILESTONE 1: Basic Associations

### Achievement
🎉 **Crossed 0.35 similarity threshold!**
First major milestone - basic word associations established.

### What Changed
- [Describe the data or training that pushed over threshold]
- [Total data: XX exchanges, YY facts, etc.]

### Evidence
Basic associations now working:
- fire → [heat, smoke, burn] ✓ Intuitive
- music → [sound, emotion, melody] ✓ Intuitive
- water → [liquid, drink] ✓ Intuitive

### Plot Observations
- Diagonal upward trajectory on entropy vs similarity
- Both metrics rising together (learning patterns)
- No flattening yet (expected)

### Next Target
- Milestone 2: 0.50 similarity (coherence threshold)
- Estimated: 2-3 more weeks with good data
- Strategy: Add factual knowledge (Wikipedia)
```

### Milestone 2: 0.50 Similarity Template

```markdown
## Entry [N] - MILESTONE 2: COHERENCE THRESHOLD! 🎉

### Achievement
🎉🎉🎉 **CROSSED 0.50 SIMILARITY - COHERENCE BEGINS!** 🎉🎉🎉

This is THE breakthrough moment.

### What Changed

- [Timeline from last milestone]

### Evidence

Quantitative:
- Similarity: 0.4X → 0.5X
- Curve FLATTENING observed ⭐
- Entropy stable at ~0.25-0.28

Qualitative:
- Strong links (🟢) on 6+ test prompts
- fire → heat, smoke, burn, flame, hot (all intuitive!)

## 📊 Plateau Documentation Template

When `detect_anomalies.sh` reports flat metrics:

```markdown
## Plateau Event - [Date]

### Detection
Anomaly detector flagged: Stuck at X.XX similarity for 4+ runs

### Context
- Last 4 runs: 0.XX, 0.XX, 0.XX, 0.XX (variation < 0.02)
- Current similarity: 0.XX
- Current entropy: 0.XX

### Data Type During Plateau
- [What kind of data was being fed]
- [Source, quality, quantity]
- [Any repetitiveness?]

### Hypothesis
Plateau likely caused by:
- [ ] Data too similar to existing
- [ ] Need different domain/style
- [ ] Learning rate too low
- [ ] Reached temporary ceiling

### Action Taken
- [What did you change]
- [New data source added?]
- [Parameters adjusted?]
- [Training cycles increased?]

### Result
- Metrics after action: [before] → [after]
- Did plateau break? [Yes/No]

### Lesson Learned
[What this plateau taught you about the system]

## 🎓 Long-Form Experiment Documentation

For major experiments (new data layer, significant change):

```markdown
## Experiment: [Name] - [Date Range]

### Objective
[What are you trying to achieve?]

### Background
[Why this experiment? What led here?]

### Hypothesis
[Specific prediction about metrics]

Example:
"Adding 20k Wikipedia facts will increase similarity by 0.08-0.12
and improve test coverage from 7/10 to 9/10 prompts."

### Method

**Data:**
- Source: [Wikipedia Simple English]
- Processing: [How formatted]
- Version: versioned_data/TIMESTAMP/
- Size: 20,000 lines

**Procedure:**
1. Version data: `./version_data.sh wiki_20k.txt "Wikipedia facts"`
2. Record baseline: [metrics]
3. Ingest in 4 batches of 5k each
4. Measure after each batch
5. Final comprehensive diagnostic

**Controls:**
- Baseline similarity: 0.35
- No parameter changes
- Same diagnostic protocol

### Results

**Timeline:**

| Batch | Lines | Similarity | Entropy | Success | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Before | 0 | 0.350 | 0.180 | 45% | Starting point |
| Batch 1 | 5k | 0.372 | 0.195 | 48% | Good start |
| Batch 2 | 10k | 0.394 | 0.208 | 51% | Steady rise |
| Batch 3 | 15k | 0.418 | 0.221 | 54% | Crossed 0.4! |
| Batch 4 | 20k | 0.445 | 0.234 | 58% | Excellent |

**Delta:**
- Similarity: +0.095 (predicted: 0.08-0.12) ✅ Within range
- Entropy: +0.054
- Success: +13%
- Test coverage: 7/10 → 9/10 ✅ Prediction confirmed

**Plot Analysis:**
- Continued diagonal rise (no flattening yet)
- Approaching coherence threshold (0.50)
- Estimate 2-3 more weeks to crossing

### Qualitative Evidence

**Batch 1 (5k lines):**
- fire→water: smoke, heat (🟠 weak)
- music→emotion: melody, sound (🟠 weak)

**Batch 4 (20k lines):**
- fire→water: heat, smoke, steam, cool (🟡 moderate!)
- music→emotion: sound, melody, emotion, rhythm (🟡 moderate!)
- robot→person: machine, artificial, human (🟠 weak - new!)

**Nearest Neighbors:**
- fire: [heat(0.72), smoke(0.68), burn(0.64)] ✓ Improving
- music: [sound(0.78), melody(0.74), song(0.69)] ✓ Good

### Conclusions

1. **Hypothesis Confirmed:** Wikipedia data effective
2. **Similarity gain:** 0.095 (within predicted range)
3. **Quality improving:** Weak → Moderate links
4. **Coverage expanding:** 7/10 → 9/10 tests

### Lessons Learned

✓ Factual data adds breadth (new concept coverage)
✓ Small batches allow early issue detection
✓ Measuring between batches reveals trends
✓ Quality of data matters more than quantity

### Next Experiment

**Goal:** Cross 0.50 similarity threshold
**Plan:** Add 10k more factual data + embedding training
**Expected:** +0.05-0.08 similarity (0.445 → 0.50+)
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

### Reproducibility

```bash
git checkout [commit_hash]
# Load data from versioned_data/TIMESTAMP/
make run_diagnostic
# Should match results above
```
