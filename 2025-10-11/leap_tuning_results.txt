RECOMMENDATIONS:
⚠️  Some targets not yet met. Further action needed:

🔧 Entropy Reduction Low:
  - Consider increasing lambda_graph_bias further
  - Lower leap_entropy_threshold to trigger more often
  - Check that embeddings are trained

🎓 Context Similarity Low:
  - Increase learning_rate_embeddings
  - Run more training cycles (100+ interactions)
  - Verify node-token embedding alignment

📈 Success Rate Low:
  - Review cluster cohesion thresholds
  - Increase min_cluster_size for better patterns
  - Add more training data
