It really makes me wonder why some people choose to eat such things.  Perhaps cultural differences play a big part in what is considered edible and delicious.  I guess we will never fully understand everyone's taste preferences, will we?  That's true, food choices can be quite personal and subjective.

That makes sense, especially in classes when it can feel like an endless hour.  Yes, the way we use our time can affect how we experience each hour completely.

What do you think caused it?  Changes in climate can create unusual weather patterns, leading to sudden storms and unexpected conditions.

It is a good idea to share your thoughts and work together for a cleaner classroom.
Do you ever feel sad when thinking about small things that have changed in life  Yes, sometimes I think about how quickly time passes and how things become different.  It is hard to see my friends less often than before  I understand that feeling; it can be tough to keep connections strong over time.

Do you ever feel disgusted by some foods when you are reading the menu at a restaurant?  I often feel that way too, especially when I see strange combinations on the menu.  Why do some restaurants think mixing flavours is necessary when it just looks unappetizing?  It can be very confusing, and it makes me wonder about their choice of ingredients.  I remember seeing a dish that had a knee of lamb but looked poorly cooked and unappealing.  That sounds terrible; presentation is important, but taste is even more necessary for a good meal.  It is so surprising how some chefs forget this simple truth while trying to be creative.  Creativity should not come at the cost of having yummy food that people enjoy eating.

How about we discuss that cruel movie we watched last night and share our disgust  I agree that the film had some truly disturbing scenes that left me feeling quite uneasy.  Yes, the way they portrayed some characters was very cruel and made me feel uncomfortable.  It seems like the teaching in that movie did not promote any positive lessons at all.  I wonder why filmmakers feel the need to include such harsh themes and images in their work.  It can be puzzling, as storytelling should engage and inspire rather than disgust the audience.  Maybe they think it creates a stronger impact, but I just feel repelled by it.  That is a fair point; perhaps we need better suggestions for more uplifting movies next time.
