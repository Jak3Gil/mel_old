Biology Basics: Living Systems

Chapter 1: The Cell

The cell is the basic unit of life. All living organisms are composed of cells. Cells come in two main types: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.

Prokaryotic cells are simpler and lack a nucleus. Bacteria are examples of prokaryotic organisms. They have DNA floating freely in the cytoplasm.

Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus that contains DNA. Plants, animals, and fungi are eukaryotic organisms. They also have membrane-bound organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Chapter 2: Genetics and DNA

DNA contains the genetic information of an organism. It is made up of four nucleotide bases: adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. These bases pair up to form the double helix structure.

Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins. Proteins are essential molecules that perform many functions in cells. The process of making proteins from DNA is called protein synthesis.

Inheritance follows specific patterns. Dominant traits are expressed when present. Recessive traits are only expressed when two copies are present.

Chapter 3: Evolution and Adaptation

Evolution is the process by which species change over time. Natural selection is the driving force of evolution. Organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce more successfully.

Adaptation refers to traits that help organisms survive in their environment. These traits develop over many generations through natural selection.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth. Different ecosystems support different types of organisms. Conservation efforts aim to protect biodiversity.

Chapter 4: Ecosystems and Ecology

An ecosystem includes all living and non-living components in an area. Energy flows through ecosystems via food chains and food webs. Producers, consumers, and decomposers play different roles.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy. This process produces oxygen as a byproduct. Cellular respiration uses oxygen to release energy from food.

Climate change affects ecosystems worldwide. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns impact plant and animal distributions.
