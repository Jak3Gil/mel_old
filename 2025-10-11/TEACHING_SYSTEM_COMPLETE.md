## 📈 **Demonstrated Learning**

### Graph Growth

```
Initial:       0 nodes,  0 edges
After Lesson 0: 14 nodes,  9 edges
After Lesson 1: 27 nodes, 27 edges
After Lesson 2: 49 nodes, 48 edges
```

**Total growth:** 49 nodes, 48 edges from 3 lessons

### Knowledge Retention

**Overall pass rates:**
- Lesson 0: 85.7% (6/7 tests)
- Lesson 1: 75.0% (6/8 tests)
- Lesson 2: 50.0% (5/10 tests)

**Average:** 70.2% retention across curriculum

**Note:** Lower pass rates on complex lessons expected (simple graph traversal, multi-hop reasoning needed)

### Learning Evidence

**Example tests that passed:**
- ✅ "What are dogs?" → "mammals" (correct)
- ✅ "What does fire produce?" → "heat" (correct)
- ✅ "What do birds have?" → "wings" (correct)
- ✅ "What is steam?" → "gas" (correct)
- ✅ "What do plants produce?" → "oxygen" (correct)

**Example tests that challenge simple traversal:**
- ❌ "What do cats produce?" → Expected "milk", got "mammals"
  - Requires 2-hop: cats→mammals→milk
  - Shows system is honest about limitations

## 🎓 **Teaching Workflow**

### Recommended Cycle

1. **Write lesson** - Create `.tch` file
2. **Teach** - `make teach FILE=lesson.tch`
3. **Review** - Check pass rate and growth
4. **Iterate** - Adjust facts or tests based on failures
5. **Commit** - Add lesson to Git when stable

### Progressive Curriculum

```
Week 1: Basics (00_basics.tch)
  → Foundation vocabulary
  → 85% retention target

Week 2: Domain knowledge (01_animals.tch)
  → Expand one domain
  → 75% retention target

Week 3: Cross-domain (02_science.tch)
  → Connect concepts
  → 50%+ retention acceptable

Week 4+: Specialized lessons
  → Deep domain knowledge
  → Track improvement over time
```

---

## 🔬 **Integration with Research System**

### Database Tracking

Add to future database queries:
```sql
-- Teaching growth over time
SELECT date, nodes_before, nodes_after, edges_added
FROM teaching_sessions
ORDER BY date;

-- Retention trends
SELECT filepath, pass_rate, growth_efficiency
FROM teaching_sessions
ORDER BY pass_rate DESC;
```

### Research Log

Document in entries:
```markdown
## Entry 3 - First Teaching Session

Taught curriculum:
  - Lesson 00: Basics (+14 nodes, +9 edges, 85.7% retention)
  - Lesson 01: Animals (+13 nodes, +18 edges, 75% retention)
  - Lesson 02: Science (+22 nodes, +21 edges, 50% retention)

Total: 49 nodes, 48 edges learned
Average retention: 70.2%
```

### Growth Tracking

```bash
# Before teaching
ls -lh melvin_brain.bin
# 6.3 KB (from learning test)

# After teaching
ls -lh melvin_brain.bin
# 15 KB (from curriculum)

# Growth: 2.4x size increase
```

3. **Growth tracking** - See nodes/edges increase
4. **Retention measurement** - Pass rate = learning success

### Short-Term

1. **Curriculum design** - Progressive complexity
2. **Knowledge domains** - Animals, science, math, language
3. **Iterative improvement** - Refine based on pass rates
4. **Scientific teaching** - Measure what works

### Long-Term

1. **Large-scale knowledge bases** - Hundreds of lessons
2. **Specialized domains** - Expert knowledge in narrow fields
3. **Teaching experiments** - Compare lesson formats
4. **Transfer learning** - Teach in one domain, test in another

---

## 🎓 **Teaching Examples**

### Simple Fact Teaching

```bash
$ make teach FILE=lessons/00_basics.tch

[INGEST] FACT: cats ARE mammals
[GROWTH] +nodes: 2 (cats, mammals)
[GROWTH] +edges: 1

✅ What are dogs? → mammals (CORRECT)
📊 Pass rate: 85.7%
```

### Progressive Curriculum

```bash
$ make teach_reset
$ make teach_dir DIR=lessons/

File 1: 14 nodes, 9 edges   (85.7% pass)
File 2: +13 nodes, +18 edges (75.0% pass)
File 3: +22 nodes, +21 edges (50.0% pass)

Final: 49 nodes, 48 edges
Success: 100% (3/3 files passed)
```

### Idempotency Test

```bash
# First teaching
$ make teach FILE=lessons/00_basics.tch
# Edges added: 9

# Second teaching (same file)
$ make teach FILE=lessons/00_basics.tch
# Duplicates skipped: 0
# Edges updated: 9 (not duplicated)
```

---

## 🔍 **Verification Results**

### What Works Well

**Direct fact recall:**
- "What are dogs?" → "mammals" ✅
- "What is water?" → "liquid" ✅
- "What do birds have?" → "wings" ✅

**Single-hop traversal:**
- "What does fire produce?" → "heat" ✅
- "Where do fish live?" → "water" ✅

**Multi-answer matching:**
- "What is water composed of?" → "oxygen" ✅
  - (Accepted: hydrogen, oxygen, H2O)

### What Needs Multi-Hop

**Two-hop reasoning:**
- "What do cats produce?" → Expected "milk"
  - Path: cats → mammals → milk
  - Got: "mammals" (stopped after 1 hop)

**Complex queries:**
- "What does fire require?" → Expected "oxygen"
  - Needs better query→node matching

**Improvement needed:** Enhance answer_query() with multi-hop traversal
